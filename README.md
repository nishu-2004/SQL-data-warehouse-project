# SQL Data Warehouse & Analytics Project

Welcome to my **SQL Data Warehouse & Analytics Project**! 🚀
This project demonstrates the end-to-end process of building a modern data warehouse, performing ETL, and generating actionable analytics for business insights.

---

## 🏗️ Project Overview

This project focuses on:

* **Data Warehousing:** Consolidating data from multiple sources into a single, structured repository.
* **ETL Pipelines:** Extracting, transforming, and loading raw data into a structured warehouse.
* **Data Modeling:** Creating fact and dimension tables optimized for analytics using a **star schema**.
* **Analytics & Reporting:** Running SQL-based queries to generate insights on sales, customer behavior, and product performance.

The goal is to demonstrate best practices in **data engineering, analytics, and reporting**.

## 🗂️ Data Architecture

This project uses the **Medallion Architecture (Bronze, Silver, Gold)**:

* **Bronze Layer:** Raw data ingested from source CSV files into SQL Server without modifications.
* **Silver Layer:** Cleansed, standardized, and normalized data for easier querying.
* **Gold Layer:** Business-ready data structured into a star schema, optimized for reporting.

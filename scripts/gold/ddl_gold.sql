/*
================================================================================
PURPOSE:
  It creates views in the gold layer

Note:
  Creates 2 dimension views and 1 fact view since the fact table contains most of the information about the user and when they had placed the order
Reasoning:
  Why the 'customers' and 'products' is a dimension?
    Contains conceptual or descriptive information.
  Why the 'sales' view is a fact?
    Contains quantitative and measured data.
Flow:
  1) Creates the 'dim_customers' view
  2) Creates the 'dim_products' view
  3) Creates the 'fact_sales' view
